Let's asume that the variable **EMACS_HOME** points to your installation
folder.

1. Set up the **HOME** environment variable. This is where your *.emacs*
file and *.emacs.d* directory will go.

2. Emacs' *load-path* variable specifies the load path.
Check it with `C-h v load-path`.

3. Text modes (for example *markdown-mode.el*) go inside EMACS_HOME/lisp/textmodes

4. Markdown mode: [download](http://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/)
