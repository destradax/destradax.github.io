# Hotmail and Outlook.com storage space
Are you considering migrating your corporate email from Google Apps to Hotmail / Outlook.com?  
Take this in mind before you do so:

The nice folks at Microsoft are <del>lying</del> confusing the public, stating that they offer Virtually unlimited storage.
and **THEY DON'T**.

Hotmail / Outlook.com only offer 5 GB of email storage.

Here's the proof:

and if they decide to remove the page or modify it, here's a screenshot (taken in march 12, 2013):

Have a look at this forum:

A user asks:

> I'm in the process of migrating my email from gmail to Outlook.com. As of today, anyone sending an email to my outlook.com email address gets the email bounced back with the following error:  
> "Diagnostic-Code: smtp;552 5.2.2 This message is larger than the current system limit or the recipient's mailbox is full. Create a shorter message body or remove attachments and try sending it again."  
> I have around 10gb of email that I would like to retain - when signing up for outlook.com it seemed to suggest that there were no space limits. While 10gb of email is large, it is by no means astronomical and would be quite common.  
> What gives? Is there anyway for me to increase the limit? If not, Outlook.com should have really informed me that xGb is the practical limit instead of suggesting that it was limitless... If there are space restrictions there really should also be a way of checking how much space I'm using.  
> HELP!!

And a Microsoft representant answers:

> Hi,  
> We're sorry for the inconvenience. Hotmail/Outlook's storage is 5gb. With the amount of file storage you have with Gmail, Outlook won't surely be able to accomodate such amount of files. If you try to migrate all your emails to Outlook, it would only store the amount of files allowed to fill in its total storage capacity. So it's possible that the sender is likely to get the bounce message since it would appear as the message is larger than your current system limit.

> Thanks!

 Way to go Microsoft!
 
 It seems that Microsoft deliberately confuses 5GB with "Virtually unlimited space".  
 I'm curios about how would they define my 8GB pendrive.
